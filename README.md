This web application is an assignment for the COMP 019: Applications Development and Emerging Technologies course at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. It was developed to apply the concepts of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and database integration using two methods: ADO.NET and ORM (Entity Framework). The project uses Microsoft SQL Server 2022 and Visual Studio 2022 as its primary tools.

**Note:** This web application is purely educational and has no affiliation with the actual One Big Run event. Images used in the application are from One Big Run and are solely for educational purposes.
